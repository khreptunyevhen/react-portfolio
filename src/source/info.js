With a user-friendly settings panel, you can customize the interface to match your style. Choose between dark and light modes, tweak the font, and select your preferred accent color to create a shopping environment that feels just right.",
        "Creating, deleting, or updating a product item is as intuitive as it gets. With a few clicks or taps, you can effortlessly manage your grocery list, ensuring you never forget an essential item again.
